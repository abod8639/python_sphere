# Rotating 3D Sphere Animation 

**Powered by DEXTER**

This repository features a Python script that creates a visually captivating 3D rotating sphere animation using Matplotlib. Designed for fun and visual delight, the script demonstrates smooth 3D transformations and modern aesthetics.

## Code Overview 

- Renders a wireframe sphere that rotates seamlessly in 3D space
- Applies a sleek dark theme for a modern look
- Uses vibrant lime green for the sphere's wireframe
- Animation is smooth and continuous, providing a hypnotic effect
- Optionally saves the animation as a GIF for easy sharing

## Key Features

-  **Dark background theme** for a stylish, minimalist appearance
-  **Lime-colored wireframe sphere** for vivid contrast
-  **Smooth 3D rotation** using matrix transformations
-  **Save as GIF** to share or use elsewhere

## Technical Details

- Utilizes `matplotlib` for 3D visualization and animation
- Rotation is achieved via matrix transformations for realistic motion
- Easily customizable: adjust rotation speed, sphere size, color, and wireframe thickness
- Clean, distraction-free visualization (no axes, grid, or toolbar)

## How to Run 

1. Ensure you have Python installed
2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Install the code :

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abod8639/python_sphere.git
   ```
4. Make the script executable (optional):

   ```bash
   chmod +x sphere.sh
   ```
5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python sphere.py
   ```

## Output 

- An interactive 3D animation window will appear
- The animation is also saved as `rotating_sphere.gif` in the project directory

## Customization Options 

You can easily modify:

- **Sphere color**: Change the `color` parameter in the script
- **Rotation speed**: Adjust the `angle_z` and `angle_y` multipliers
- **Sphere size**: Modify the `radius` value
- **Wireframe thickness**: Set the `linewidth` parameter

Enjoy the mesmerizing rotation!
